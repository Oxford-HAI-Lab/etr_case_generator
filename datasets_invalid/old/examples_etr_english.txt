I'm playing a card game against the computer. It's an unusual game with an      
unusual deck of cards. I have some clues about what's going on, and I need to   
figure some more things out through logical reasoning. Here's what I know so    
far:                                                                            

 • Either the one is not square, or the one is square and the one is yellow     
 • Either the one is yellow and the five is not red and the one is square, or   
   the one is square

   five is not castable, or the five is not red

                                    question                                    
I'm a dream researcher studying beings that appear in shared dreams. I need to  
understand their nature through logical analysis. Here's what we've observed:   

 • There is some A such that A is not reality-bridging and A is memory-weaving  
 • Either mindshaper is not memory-weaving, or mindshaper is not                
   reality-bridging                                                             

For the purpose of this question, I want you to write what follows in English.  
Please be succinct, precise and clear in your answer. Write a logical statement 
of the form "From the premises, we can conclude that ..." and then clearly write
your conclusion. Please be succinct, precise, and clear.                        

What if anything follows?
