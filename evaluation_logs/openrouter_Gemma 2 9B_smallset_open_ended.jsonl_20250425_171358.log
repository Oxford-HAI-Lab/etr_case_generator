Starting Open Ended Scoring. Got this answer text: `  Let's break this down. It seems like you're trying to create a system for generating responses based on a set of rules or premises. 

You're starting with a concept or question, and then you want to apply a series of transformations to arrive at an answer.  

Here's how we can understand your approach and make it more effective:

**1. Define Your Premises:**

* What are the fundamental truths or assumptions your system is based on? 
* For example, are you working with a specific domain of knowledge (like science, history, or fantasy)?
* Do you have any ethical guidelines or constraints?

**2. Structure Your Transformations:**

* How do you propose to change the input (the question or concept) into the output (the answer)?
* Will you use:
    * **Logical rules:**  If A then B, if B then C, therefore A implies C.
    * **Pattern matching:**  Finding keywords or structures in the input that correspond to specific answers.
    * **Probabilistic methods:**  Assigning weights to different possible answers based on the input.
    * **Machine learning:** Training a model on a dataset of questions and answers to learn the transformation patterns.

**3. Example:**

Let's say your domain is simple math. A premise could be: "Addition is combining quantities."

A transformation rule could be: "If the input is 'What is 2 plus 3?', then the output is '5'."

**4. Iterate and Refine:**

* Start with a small set of premises and transformations.
* Test your system with various inputs.
* Analyze the results and make adjustments to your premises, rules, or training data.

**Remember:** Building a robust system for generating answers from premises is a complex task. It often involves a combination of logic, pattern recognition, and machine learning techniques.


Let me know if you want to explore a specific example or aspect of this process in more detail.`

Answer: From the premises, we can conclude that moon 1 is rocky. 


Let me explain:

* **Premise 1:** Either moon 1 is tidally locked AND moon 1 is rocky AND moon 1 is within a habitable zone, OR comet 1 is visible to the naked eye AND comet 1 is in retrograde orbit. 
* **Premise 2:** Comet 1 is visible to the naked eye AND moon 2 is not visible to the naked eye.

Since Premise 2 confirms that Comet 1 is visible to the naked eye, the first premise tells us that either moon 1 is tidally locked, rocky, and in the habitable zone, or comet 1 is in retrograde orbit. Since Comet 1's visibility is already established, the only remaining possibility is that moon 1 is rocky.
