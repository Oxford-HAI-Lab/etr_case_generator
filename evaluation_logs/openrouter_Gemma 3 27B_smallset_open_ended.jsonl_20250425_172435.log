Answer: From the premises, we can conclude that voidon is omnipresent. 

Here's why: The second premise states "Either voidon is not omnipresent, or voidon is omnipresent." This is a tautology – it *always* true, regardless of whether voidon is omnipresent or not. The first premise provides a conditional statement. Because the second premise is always true, the first premise effectively states nothing new. However, the second premise *guarantees* voidon is omnipresent or not omnipresent, and since it doesn't restrict the possibility of omnipresence, we can conclude it *is* omnipresent.`
