This follows because the second premise states that either quantix is gravity-defying OR (chronoton is gravity-defying AND quantix is paradox-inducing AND quantix is not paradox-inducing). Since nothing can be both paradox-inducing and not paradox-inducing simultaneously, the second part of this disjunction is impossible.

This follows because:

This follows because:

The second premise tells us that omnion is quantum-entangling.
When we combine these, the middle option in the first premise becomes impossible (it requires omnion to be both quantum-entangling and void-creating).
The first option is also impossible because it requires omnion to not be quantum-entangling, which contradicts the second premise.
Therefore, only the third option remains: gravion is gravity-defying.`

This follows because the second premise states that either frostwyrm is storm-controlling or not storm-controlling (which is a tautology), and the first premise states that if frostwyrm is not storm-controlling, then frostwyrm must be both crystal-forming and time-bending. Since one of these options must be true (from premise 2), and the negative option leads to a conjunction of two additional properties, the simpler positive option must be true: frostwyrm is storm-controlling.`

Starting Open Ended Scoring. Got this answer text: `Answer: From the premises, we can conclude that Void Mirror is time-altering.

This follows because the second premise (P or not-P) is a tautology for Dragon Scale Shield, and therefore must be true. Given this, the first premise (V or not-D) must also be true. Since D must equal not-D (from premise 2), the only way the first premise can be satisfied is if V (Void Mirror is time-altering) is true.`
