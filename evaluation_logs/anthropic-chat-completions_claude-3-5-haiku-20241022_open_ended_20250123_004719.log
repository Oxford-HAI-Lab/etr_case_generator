Starting Open Ended Scoring. Got this answer text: Answer: From the premises, we can conclude that stormgriffin is phase-shifting.

The reasoning is:
1. The first premise gives two possibilities: phase-shifting or light-emitting
2. The second premise states that nothing is light-emitting
3. Therefore, by elimination, stormgriffin must be phase-shifting

Starting Open Ended Scoring. Got this answer text: Answer: From the premises, we can conclude that Moonstone Bracelet is starlight-channeling.

The reasoning is:
1. The first premise states that all items are truth-revealing.
2. The second premise is a disjunction (either/or statement) about the Moonstone Bracelet.
3. If the Moonstone Bracelet were not truth-revealing, it would contradict the first premise.
4. Therefore, the Moonstone Bracelet must be starlight-channeling.

Starting Open Ended Scoring. Got this answer text: Answer: From the premises, we can conclude that Moonstone Bracelet is starlight-channeling.

The reasoning is:
1. The first premise is a tautology (if X is truth-revealing, then X is truth-revealing)
2. The second premise gives us an exclusive "or" between two properties
3. Since the first option (starlight-channeling) is possible, it must be true by the disjunctive syllogism

Starting Open Ended Scoring. Got this answer text: Let me solve this systematically using logical reasoning:

First, I'll analyze the given premises:
1. Either:
   a) telepathy is not space-bending, OR
   b) (telepathy is reality-changing AND telepathy is object-reading), OR
   c) (psychokinesis is emotionally sensitive AND psychokinesis is soul-traveling)

2. Either:
   a) telepathy is object-reading, OR
   b) (telepathy is reality-changing AND psychokinesis is reality-changing)

After careful logical analysis, I can definitively state:

Answer: From the premises, we can conclude that telepathy is object-reading.

This follows because in the second premise, the only way the statement can be true is if telepathy is object-reading, given the alternative would require both telepathy and psychokinesis to be reality-changing, which is not supported by the first premise.

Starting Open Ended Scoring. Got this answer text: Answer: From the premises, we can conclude that stormgriffin is not aura-healing.

The reasoning is:
1. The first premise about light-emitting creatures is a tautology and doesn't provide new information.
2. The second premise gives us a disjunction (either/or statement).
3. If the first part of the disjunction (stormgriffin is phase-shifting and stormgriffin is crystal-forming) is false, then the alternative must be true.
4. Therefore, stormgriffin is not aura-healing.
