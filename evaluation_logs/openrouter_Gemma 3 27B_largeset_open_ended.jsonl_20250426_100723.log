Answer: From the premises, we can conclude that nightmare is thought-reading.

Here's why: The second premise is a tautology (always true). The first premise simplifies to "dreamweaver is thought-reading". Since the second premise doesn't constrain nightmare's thought-reading ability, and the first premise establishes dreamweaver's, nothing logically follows *about* nightmare *except* that the second premise doesn't rule out nightmare being a thought-reader. However, the second premise *does* state that nightmare *either* is or is not a thought-reader. Since the premises don't preclude nightmare being a thought-reader, and the second premise doesn't require it to be *not* a thought-reader, we can't conclude anything *except* that it's possible for nightmare to be a thought-reader.

However, if we interpret the first premise as implying that *if* X is thought-reading, *then* dreamweaver is thought-reading, and combine this with the second premise, we can deduce that nightmare is thought-reading. This is because if nightmare is thought-reading (X), then dreamweaver is thought-reading (from the first premise). The second premise doesn't contradict this.
