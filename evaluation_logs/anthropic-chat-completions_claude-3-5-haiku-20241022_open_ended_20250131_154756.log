1. We have two premises:
   • A complex first premise involving multiple psychic ability characteristics
   • A second premise that "empathy is reality-changing"

2. From the first premise, the second part of the disjunction (the "or" clause) becomes true because the first part cannot be true (since we know empathy is reality-changing)

3. In that disjunction's second part, we can conclude that:
   • empathy is not matter-moving
   • clairvoyance is not prescient
   • psychometry is not emotionally sensitive
