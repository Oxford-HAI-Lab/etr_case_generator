Starting Open Ended Scoring. Got this answer text: `Answer: From the premises, we can conclude that either omnion is quantum-entangling, or omnion is not void-creating.`
Rewritten by model: Answer: {quantumEntangling(omnion()),~voidCreating(omnion())}
Matched and parsed: {quantumEntangling(omnion()),~voidCreating(omnion())}
Final ETR text: {quantumEntangling(omnion()),~voidCreating(omnion())}
Compare to predicted: {~voidCreating(omnion()*)}
Logical equivalence: False
ETR predicted: False
