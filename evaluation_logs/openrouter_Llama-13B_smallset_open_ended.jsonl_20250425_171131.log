Starting Open Ended Scoring. Got this answer text: `Answer: From the premises, we can conclude that precognition is not object-reading.

Explanation:

1. If precognition were object-reading, then it would be possible to read the object without being in the same space as the object.
2. However, the second premise states that precognition is either object-reading or space-bending.
3. If precognition were space-bending, then it would be possible to bend space without being in the same space as the object.
4. But the second premise states that precognition is not space-bending.
5. Therefore, the only possibility left is that precognition is not object-reading.`

Starting Open Ended Scoring. Got this answer text: `Answer: From the premises, we can conclude that either quasarium is time-dilating and quasarium is magnetic, or radionite is not corrosive.

Explanation:

1. The first premise states that either quasarium is time-dilating and quasarium is magnetic, or radionite is not corrosive. This means that if quasarium is time-dilating, it must be magnetic.
2. The second premise states that either zycron is time-dilating, or zycron is time-dilating and radionite is time-dilating. This means that if zycron is time-dilating, it must be time-dilating and radionite is time-dilating.
3. The third premise states that either radionite is not time-dilating and radionite is time-dilating, or radionite is not magnetic. This means that if radionite is not time-dilating, it must be not magnetic.

Therefore, we can conclude that either quasarium is time-dilating and quasarium is magnetic, or radionite is not corrosive.`
