Starting Open Ended Scoring. Got this answer text: `Answer: From the premises, we can conclude that solarium is not plasma-like.

Explanation:
- Premise 1: (Solarium is corrosive ∧ Solarium is electrically insulating) ∨ (Solarium is not plasma-like).
- Premise 2: (Fluxium is corrosive ∧ Aurorium is electrically insulating) ∨ (Voidite is radioactive ∧ Solarium is electrically insulating ∧ Solarium is self-repairing).
- Premise 3: Voidite is not radioactive.

From Premise 3, Voidite is not radioactive, so the second part of Premise 2 (after the "or") is false. Therefore, for Premise 2 to be true, the first part must be true: Fluxium is corrosive and Aurorium is electrically insulating.

Now, regarding Premise 1: it is of the form (A ∧ B) ∨ C. If (A ∧ B) is false, then C must be true for the whole statement to be true. However, we do not know whether solarium is corrosive and electrically insulating. But if we cannot guarantee (A ∧ B), then to ensure the truth of Premise 1, we must accept that solarium is not plasma-like.

Thus, we can conclude: solarium is not plasma-like.`

Starting Open Ended Scoring. Got this answer text: `Answer: From the premises, we can conclude that Delta Guardian is a future predictor.

Explanation:
- In the first premise, one side of the "either" is "Delta Guardian is quantum computing and Delta Guardian is a future predictor."
- In the second premise, one side of the "either" is "Lambda Shifter is a future predictor and Delta Guardian is a future predictor."
- In both cases, Delta Guardian being a future predictor appears as part of the disjunction.
- If Delta Guardian were not a future predictor, both disjunctions would fail, which is not allowed in logic (at least one side must be true).
- Therefore, Delta Guardian must be a future predictor.`

Starting Open Ended Scoring. Got this answer text: `Answer: From the premises, we can conclude that the two is castable and the two is red.

Explanation:
- In the first premise, one side of the "either...or..." is "the two is castable and the two is red," and the other side is a conjunction that includes "the queen is red and the queen is not red," which is a contradiction (something cannot be both red and not red).
- Since the second side is a contradiction and therefore false, the first side must be true for the "either...or..." statement to hold.
- Therefore, the two is castable and the two is red.`
