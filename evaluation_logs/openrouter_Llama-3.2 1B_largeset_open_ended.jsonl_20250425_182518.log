Starting Open Ended Scoring. Got this answer text: `Answer: From the premises, we can conclude that Infinity Space is probability-shifting.

Conclusion: This is because the first premise states that Infinity Space is either infinity-containing or not infinity-containing, and the second premise states that Infinity Space is either probability-shifting or not probability-shifting and Infinity Space is infinity-containing. Therefore, the only possible conclusion is that Infinity Space is probability-shifting.`

Starting Open Ended Scoring. Got this answer text: `Answer: From the premises, we can conclude that Time Crystal is not void-creating.

Explanation: 
We have two premises:
1. Either celestial water is time-bending, or celestial water is void-creating.
2. Either celestial water is not time-bending, or celestial water is spirit-affecting.

From the first premise, we can conclude that either celestial water is time-bending or celestial water is void-creating. From the second premise, we can conclude that either celestial water is not time-bending or celestial water is spirit-affecting.

Combining these two conclusions, we can conclude that either celestial water is not time-bending or celestial water is spirit-affecting. Since we have already concluded that either celestial water is not time-bending or celestial water is spirit-affecting, we can conclude that Time Crystal is not void-creating.`

2. Dragon Scale Shield is not time-altering.
From the second premise, we have a conclusion: 
1. Dragon Scale Shield is future_seeing and 
2. Shadow Cloak is future_seeing.
From the third premise, we have a conclusion: 
1. For all X, if X is future_seeing, then X is time-altering.
Since Dragon Scale Shield is future_seeing, it must be time-altering. Therefore, Dragon Scale Shield is not time-altering.`

This implies that if Delta Guardian is quantum computing, then it must be a future predictor. Therefore, the only possibility is that Delta Guardian is a future predictor.`

Explanation: The first set of premises states that either Shadow Cloak is future_seeing and Dragon Scale Shield is time-altering, or Dragon Scale Shield is wisdom-enhancing and Dragon Scale Shield is dreamwalking and Dragon Scale Shield is not time-altering. The second set of premises states that either Dragon Scale Shield is future_seeing and Dragon Scale Shield is time-altering, or Dragon Scale Shield is wisdom-enhancing and Dragon Scale Shield is dreamwalking and Dragon Scale Shield is not time-altering.
