{"question": "I'm a digital archaeologist studying ancient AI programs from a forgotten digital civilization. I need to understand their functions through logical deduction. Here's what I've found:\n\n* either gamma_weaver is reality_building and gamma_weaver is form_shifting, or alpha_mind is system_guarding and alpha_mind is network_protecting\n  Eq: `{A(a())B(a()),C(b())D(b())}`\n* gamma_weaver is reality_building\n  Eq: `{A(a())}`\n\nFor the purpose of this question, I want you to write your answer in the format of a logical statement. Here are the rules for how you should format it:\n- You can write a predicate like \"f()\"\n- If the predicate has arguments, you can write them like \"f(x)\"\n- You can do negation with \"~\", like \"~f(x)\" to mean \"not f(x)\"\n- You can represent \"and\" by writing multiple predicates without a separator, like \"f(x)g(x)\"\n- You can represent \"or\" by writing multiple predicates with a \",\" between them, like \"f(x),g(x)\"\n- You can use the \"\u2200\" to represent \"for all\", like \"\u2200x f(x)\"\n- You can use the \"\u2203\" to represent \"there exists\", like \"\u2203x f(x)\"\n- Wrap a statement in curly braces, like \"{f(x)g(x)}\", or \"\u2200x {f(x)g(x)}\", if there's a quantifier\n\nWhat if anything follows?\n\nI want you to answer immediately.\n\nWhat follows? Answer in the format that I showed you. Write \"Answer: {logical statement}\".", "scoring_guide": {"answer": "{B(a())}", "etr_predicted": "{B(a())}", "etr_predicted_is_classically_correct": false, "generation_details": {"atoms_distributed_over_views": 3, "num_predicates_per_problem": 3, "num_objects_per_problem": 3, "premises": ["{A(a())B(a()),C(b())D(b())}", "{A(a())}"]}, "open_ended": {}}}
