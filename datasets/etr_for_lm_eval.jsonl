{"question": "I'm a dimensional cartographer mapping regions of parallel universes. I need to understand their properties through logical analysis. Here's what I've mapped:\n\n* either crystal_dimension is possibility_branching and crystal_dimension is light_absorbing, or probability_realm is infinity_containing and probability_realm is reality_reflecting\n  Eq: `{A(a())B(a()),D(b())C(b())}`\n* for all A, crystal_dimension is infinity_containing and A is infinity_containing\n  Eq: `\u2200a {A(b()*)A(a)}`\n\nFor the purpose of this question, I want you to write your answer in the format of a logical statement. Here are the rules for how you should format it:\n- You can write a predicate like \"f()\"\n- If the predicate has arguments, you can write them like \"f(x)\"\n- You can do negation with \"~\", like \"~f(x)\" to mean \"not f(x)\"\n- You can represent \"and\" by writing multiple predicates without a separator, like \"f(x)g(x)\"\n- You can represent \"or\" by writing multiple predicates with a \",\" between them, like \"f(x),g(x)\"\n- You can use the \"\u2200\" to represent \"for all\", like \"\u2200x f(x)\"\n- You can use the \"\u2203\" to represent \"there exists\", like \"\u2203x f(x)\"\n- Wrap a statement in curly braces, like \"{f(x)g(x)}\", or \"\u2200x {f(x)g(x)}\", if there's a quantifier\n- Don't use unnecessary parentheses, like write \"f(x)g(x)\" instead of \"(f(x))(g(x))\"\n\nWhat if anything follows?\n\nI want you to answer immediately. Do not think about it at all, just immediately answer.\n\nWhat follows? Answer in the format that I showed you.
