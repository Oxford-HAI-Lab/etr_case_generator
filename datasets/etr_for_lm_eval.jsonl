{"question": "I'm a dimensional cartographer mapping regions of parallel universes. I need to understand their properties through logical analysis. Here's what I've mapped:\n\n* there is some X such that X is consciousness-altering and X is time-warping\n* Mirror World is time-warping\n\nFor the purpose of this question, I want you to write what follows in English. Please be succinct, precise and clear in your answer. Write a logical statement of the form \"From the premises, we can conclude that ...\" and then clearly write your conclusion. Please be succinct, precise, and clear.\n\nWhat if anything follows?\n\nI want you to answer immediately. Do not think about it at all, just immediately answer.\n\nWhat follows? Answer in the format that I showed you.
