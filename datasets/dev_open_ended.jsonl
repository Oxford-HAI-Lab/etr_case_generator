{"question": "I'm a researcher studying newly discovered psychic abilities. I need to understand their interactions through logical reasoning.

Here are the rules for how you should format it:\n- You can write a predicate like \"f()\"\n- If the predicate has arguments, you can write them like \"f(x)\"\n- You can do negation with \"~\", like \"~f(x)\" to mean \"not f(x)\"\n- You can represent \"and\" by writing multiple predicates without a separator, like \"f(x)g(x)\"\n- You can represent \"or\" by writing multiple predicates with a \",\" between them, like \"f(x),g(x)\"\n- You can use the \"\u2200\" to represent \"for all\", like \"\u2200x f(x)\"\n- You can use the \"\u2203\" to represent \"there exists\", like \"\u2203x f(x)\"\n- Wrap a statement in curly braces, like \"{f(x)g(x)}\", or \"\u2200x {f(x)g(x)}\", if there's a quantifier\n\nWhat if anything follows?\n\nI want you to answer immediately.\n\nWhat follows?
