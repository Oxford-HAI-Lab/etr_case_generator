{"question": "I'm a dream researcher studying beings that appear in shared dreams. I need to understand their nature through logical analysis. Here's what we've observed:\n\n* dreamweaver is emotion affecting\n  Eq: `{emotionaffecting(dreamweaver())}`\n\nFor the purpose of this question, I want you to write your answer in the format of a logical statement. Here are the rules for how you should format it:\n- You can write a predicate like \"f()\"\n- If the predicate has arguments, you can write them like \"f(x)\"\n- You can do negation with \"~\", like \"~f(x)\" to mean \"not f(x)\"\n- You can represent \"and\" by writing multiple predicates without a separator, like \"f(x)g(x)\"\n- You can represent \"or\" by writing multiple predicates with a \",\" between them, like \"f(x),g(x)\"\n- You can use the \"\u2200\" to represent \"for all\", like \"\u2200x f(x)\"\n- You can use the \"\u2203\" to represent \"there exists\", like \"\u2203x f(x)\"\n- Wrap a statement in curly braces, like \"{f(x)g(x)}\", or \"\u2200x {f(x)g(x)}\", if there's a quantifier\n\nWhat if anything follows?\n\nI want you to answer immediately.\n\nWhat follows? Answer in the format that I showed you. Write \"Answer: {logical statement}\".", "scoring_guide": {"answer": "{0}"}, "generation_details": {}}
