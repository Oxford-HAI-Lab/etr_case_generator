# Overall Results

You can see that in this run, claude-3.5-haiku was correct in 30% of cases, but gave the exact answer predicted by ETR's default_inference_procedure in 35% of cases.

You can also see that a parse error occurred 10% of the time. I'm working on that, and I've removed problems 1 and 3 which had errors.

# Details of 20 Problemss

How to read this:

doc/question -- the text of the prompt sent to the LLM.
doc/scoring_guide/generation_details/premises_etr -- the premises in pyetr format
resps -- the full text from the LLM
model_ansswer -- the LLM's response converted to pyetr format by GPT-4
doc/scoring_guide/etr_predicted -- the result of ETR's default_inference_procedure on the premises
correct -- whether model_answer is logically sound
is_etr_predicted -- default_procedure_does_it_follow(premises, model_answer)
is_etr_predicted_exact -- whether model_answer and etr_predicted are equivalent
parse_error -- whether the system failed to understand the LLM's response in PyETR

I'm an astronomer studying newly discovered celestial bodies. I've made some observations and
I need to use logical reasoning to figure out what's going on. Here's what I know so far:

 • if planet Y is orbited by satellites, then planet Y is tidally locked
 • planet Y is orbited by satellites

For the purpose of this question, I want you to write what follows in English. Please be
succinct, precise and clear in your answer. Write a logical statement of the form "From the
premises, we can conclude that ..." and then clearly write your conclusion. Please be
succinct, precise, and clear.

I'm playing a card game against the computer. It's an unusual game with an unusual deck of
cards. I have some clues about what's going on, and I need to figure some more things out
through logical reasoning. Here's what I know so far:

 • if the one is round, then the one is castable
 • the one is round and the eight is not round
